# ML Specialization Coursera
Special thanks to Andrew Ng and the rest of the Coursera team for creating a very accessible introductory Machine Learning Specialization. This repository contains the unsolved versions of the programming assignments as well as the quizzes and exploratory labs provided. 

## How to do the exercises
The exercises typically use Interactive Python Notebooks (ie: the `.ipynb` files). You can use tools such as [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Deepnote](deepnote.com), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

Please feel free to fork a copy of this repository over for your personal use. Feel free to create a GitHub issue if something is missing. Happy learning :)
